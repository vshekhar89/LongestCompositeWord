# LongestCompositeWord
This repository contains the code to find the two largest concatenated words from a list of words containes in a file. </br>
 For example consider the files contains the words:</br>
 cats</br>
 dog</br>
 catsdog</br>
 DoginHospital</br>
 catsdogs</br>
 dogcats</br>
 The two longest concatenated words in this list are catsdog and dogcats as they are made by combination of other words
 already present in the list.</br>
 The code also returns the total number of concatenated words present in the file.</br>

#Approach Used:

1) Read the test file and create a hash set with the input words.Creating a has set will help in retrieving the words later in</br> 
constant time.</br>

2) Sort the input words in the descending order of their lengths by using a custom comparator.</br>
The idea behind this is that we donâ€™t need to go thorough the entire list of words again in average case to find the two largest concatenated words.</br>

3) Iterate over the list of words and check whether they are valid concatenated words.</br>
 This is done by taking substrings of the word starting from left and checking whether it exists in the hash set. If it does,</br>
 then the remainder of the word is checked by calling the function recursively. </br>

4) For every concatenated word found, increase the count of concatenated words.</br>

5) Print the first two concatenated words found and the count of total concatenated words.</br>

# Testing Instructions:

 1) Please compile all the attached java files.</br>

 2) Run Test.java and provide the absolute/relative path of the file "wordsforproblem.txt" as an argument.</br>
